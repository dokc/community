# Operator Special Interest Group
The DoK Operator SIG is a Special Interest Group (SIG) with a focus on operators. The scope is to bring members from our community together to discuss gaps in information around operators for the industry-at-large and co-create projects to fill the gap. 

## Meetings
Meetings will be held every two weeks starting the last week of November 2022. Details coming soon.
